This is the way I updated the master branch

This kind of error occurs commonly after deleting the initial code on your project

So, go ahead, first of all, verify the actual remote version, then remove the origin add the comment, and copy the repo URL into the project files.

$ git remote -v
$ git remote rm origin
$ git commit -m "your commit"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
$ git push -f origin master
